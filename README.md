# Anax RTTI

## BRIEF
The Anax RTTI library is designed for to be used as an alternative to RTTI. You should only use most of, if not all, of these library features if your class depends on virtual functions and objects of the class will change during run-time.

## FEATURES
1. Object creation through strings
2. Fast class information and comparrision

### NOTES
1. Examples are included, please refer to them.
2. This library _is_ C++03 compatible, but the examples are written with C++11.

## INSPIRATION
The creation through strings is inspired from [this](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/17746/entity-component-systems-in-c-how-do-i-discover-types-and-construct-component) question in the stackexchange gamedev community.
